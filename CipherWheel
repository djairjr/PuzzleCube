12, 30, 20, 12mm



Alphabet wheel
First render a cog
26, 20, 20, 12 mm

Then render a grid -> polar grid
Snap it to the centre of the gear

To make the grid lines line up with the notches rather than the holes, need to rotate the cog by half a tooth width, so
Then from the transform ->< rotate menu option,
rotate by 360/26/2

If SVG goes off when transferring to LaerGRBL, then ungroup and regroup all ovbjects to remove transforms from SVG:
