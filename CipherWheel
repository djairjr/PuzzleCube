Inkscape has a built-in gears module for rendering gears, which can be found under the *Extensions -> Render -> Gear* menu item. 
However, the functionality of this module is relatively limited - there are no options to create racks, inner gears, or to customise the number of spokes, for example.
So, instead, we'll install an alternative gears module, which you can download from https://github.com/jnweiger/inkscape-gears-dev

To install this extension:
 - Download the latest .zip file from https://github.com/jnweiger/inkscape-gears-dev/archive/master.zip
 - Extract this archive and copy the *gears-dev.py* and *gears-dev.inx* files to your inkscape extensions directory (On Windows, this is %APPDATA%/inkscape/extensions)
 - Restart Inkscape
 
 You should now have a new menu option under *Extensions -> Render -> Gear-dev*





12, 30, 20, 12mm



Alphabet wheel
First render a cog
26, 20, 20, 12 mm

Then render a grid -> polar grid
Snap it to the centre of the gear

To make the grid lines line up with the notches rather than the holes, need to rotate the cog by half a tooth width, so
Then from the transform ->< rotate menu option,
rotate by 360/26/2

If SVG goes off when transferring to LaerGRBL, then ungroup and regroup all ovbjects to remove transforms from SVG:
